## Instructions

This is a single player game played against a bot.
The rules are simple:
- You need to press HIT button to draw out a random card.
- You can keep hitting the HIT button so as to make your score near 21.
- But Beware! If the score spills out greater than 21, you Bust.
- Once, you are done click on STAND, and let the bot have its chance.
- If his score turns out to be greater than yours then you lose and vice-versa.
- However, if both the scores are equal or both end up Busting, it will be called a draw.
- Once the winner is declared, press DEAL to register the score and start over.

##### Happy Playing!
